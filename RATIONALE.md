### Braces vs Indentation
You are indenting your code. Your indentation has a specific meaning to you and is how you expect your code to run. This meaning is ignored and overridden by code that uses braces (i.e. multiple indented lines after an `if` statement while missing the `if` statement's braces). No need to define the same thing twice. Braces are redundant and error-prone.
